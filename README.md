A Meme Application through which we can enjoy watching new memes.

#Libraries Used:

1. Volley

  i. Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster. Volley is available on GitHub.

  ii. Volley offers the following benefits:

  a) Automatic scheduling of network requests.
  b) Multiple concurrent network connections.
  c) Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence.
  d) Support for request prioritization.
  e) Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel.
  f) Ease of customization, for example, for retry and backoff.
  g) Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network.
  h) Debugging and tracing tools.

2. Glide

  i. Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource      pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.

  ii. Glide supports fetching, decoding, and displaying video stills, images, and animated GIFs. Glide includes a flexible API that allows developers to plug in toalmost       any network stack. By default Glide uses a custom HttpUrlConnection based stack, but also includes utility libraries plug in to Google's Volley project or Square's       OkHttp library instead.

  iii. Glide's primary focus is on making scrolling any kind of a list of images as smooth and fast as possible, but Glide is also effective for almost any case where          you need to fetch, resize, and display a remote image.
